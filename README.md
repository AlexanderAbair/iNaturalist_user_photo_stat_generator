# iNaturalist_user_photo_stat_generator
Just playing with some iNaturalist API and JSON stuff in python. This script counts the number of photos uploaded by users and finds average number of uploads per observation and rates of photo uploads over time.

I'm not great at coding, so there are obvious inefficiencies.  But it seems to work well for the tasks I designed it for.  It would be fun to alter some functions so that it would be able to get full stats for users with >10,000 observations.
